  /* 
  In the given preoder '-1' means NULL and first element in the preorder represents the root node and the next follows 
  for the left node then right if any child nodes have its sub-nodes then it will be represented after the given preorder element

  Here in the preorder = {1, 2, -1, -1, 3, 4, -1, 5, -1, -1};
  - '1' means the root node
  - '2' means the left to the root node
  - '-1' means the left to the '2' node and other '-1' means the right to the '2' node
  - '3' means the right to the root node
  - '4' means the left to the '3' node
  - '-1' means the left to the '4' node
  - '5' means the right to the '4' node
  - '-1' means the left to the '5' node and otber '-1' means the right to the '5' node

  So that's how the tree will be represented with the preorder array

TERMS IN TREE:
1.Root             : The topmost node of the tree from where we can able to traverse the whole tree(1)
2.Parent & child   : If a node is connected downward (1 -> parent, 2, 3 -> children)
3.Leaf Node        : Node with node children (2, 5 -> leaf nodes) 
4.Internal Node    : Node having atleast one child
5.Subtree          : Any node + its children forms a subtree (subtree of 3 -> (3, 4, 5))
6.Height of tree   : Number of edges in longest path from the root to leaf (height = 3) (path: 1->3->4->5, edges: 3,4,5)
7.Depth of Node    : Distance from root to that node (Depth of 1 = 0, for 3 = 1, for 5 = 3)
8.Level            : Same as depth but starts from 1 (Level of 1 = 1, for 3 = 2, for 5 = 4)
9.Degree of Node   : Number of children
10.Binary Tree     : Each node has atmost 2 children (left n right)

11.Full Binary Tree  : Every node has either 0 or 2 children
12.Complete Binary Tree : All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, and last level is filled from left
13.Perfect Binary Tree  : All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaves are at same level
14.Balanced Tree     : Height difference between left and right subtree is at most 1
15.Skewed Tree       : Tree where all nodes are either left or right child (like a linked list)
16.Ancestor          : Any node on the path from root to a given node (for 5 → 1,3,4 are ancestors)
17.Descendant        : Any node in the subtree of a node (for 3 → 4,5 are descendants)
18.Sibling           : Nodes having the same parent (2 and 3 are siblings)
19.Path              : Sequence of nodes from one node to another (1→3→4→5)
20.Diameter of Tree  : Longest path between any two nodes in the tree
