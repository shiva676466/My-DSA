*================* THEORY *================*

A graph is a data structure used to represnt the relationships between objects.
- Objects: vertices(nodes)
- Connections(relationship) between them called 'edges'
Ex: 
    - cities connected by roads
    - users connected in social networks
    - webpages connected by hyperlinks
    - computers connected in networks

Basic Terminology: 
- consider this graph:

A ----- B
|       |
|       |
C ----- D
Here, A, B, C, D are 'vertices' and the connected lines between them are called 'edges'.

Types of graphs are based on different categories:
1.Based on 'SIZE':
    - finite graph: a finite graph is a graph with finite no of vertices and edges.
    - infinite graph: this graph has an infinite no of vertices and edges, these graphs nodes and edges are uncountable.

2.Based on 'STRUCTURE':
    - trivial graph: a graph is said to be trivial if a finite graph having only 1 vertex and 0 edges.
    - simple graph: this graph doesnt contain more than one edge b/w the pair of vertices.
    - multi graph: graph which contains parallel edges but doesnt contains self-loop is a multi-graph
    - null graph: a graph of 'order' and 'size' are 0 is called a null graph; order = no of vertices, size = no of edges
    - complete graph: a simple graph of n vertices in which each node has (n-1) edges or 'degree' of each node is (n-1), means we can 
                        travel to any vertex with the help of one vertex in this graph; degree of a vertex = no of edges connected to that vertex.

3.Based on 'DIRECTION':
    - directed graph: graph with edges having direction such that we cant able to travel directed side from the vertex to another one.
    - un-directed graph: graph with edges having no direction so that we can travel to any vertex that is connected to the given vertex.

4.Based on 'WEIGHT':
    - weighted graph: graphs in which edges having weight(number) that represents cost, time or distance.
    - un-weighted graph: graphs in which edges having no weight and all the edges are treated equally.

5.Based on 'CONNECTIVITY':
    - connected graph: a graph is said to be connected if there exists atleast one path b/w each n every pair of nodes (we can travel whole graph with the help of only one node).
    - disconnected graph: a graph where all nodes are NOT reachable from each other is called a disconnected graph.

Graph Representation are of mainly 2 types:
1. Adjacency Matrix: for the graph:      0 -- 1
                                         |    |
                                         2 -- 3
    the adjacency matrix is: 
                                      0   1   2   3
                         rows:  0 : | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
                                1 : | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
                                2 : | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
                                3 : | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0
2. Adjacency List
